\section{Risk Analysis}

Given below is the risk register table which has all risks possible in the project, the results of the risks, and actions that can be taken to mitigate those risks.

\begin{table}[ht]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.75cm}|p{5cm}|p{1.75cm}|p{1cm}|p{1.75cm}|p{4cm}|}
\hline
Rank & Hazard/Impact & Likelihood & Impact & Exposure & Action\\
\hline
1 & Underestimation of time needed; may not complete project goals & 3 & 4 & 12 & Identify essential and non-essential parts of project, build early prototype \\
\hline
2 & Unfamiliarity with advanced math/ML; may take longer than expected, thus disturb plan & 4 & 3 & 12 & Have planned period of study as part of plan \\
\hline
3 & Insufficient compute power available; may be unable to run code till completion & 2 & 4 & 8 & Use Voicebase grid, ask supervisor for compute resources \\
\hline
4 & Insufficient contact with supervisor; may take longer to understand concepts, thus disturb plan & 2 & 3 & 6 & Schedule repeating meetings with supervisor in advance \\
\hline
5 & Lack of Kaldi experience; may take longer than expected, thus disturb plan & 2 & 3 & 6 & Understand DIHARD baseline system, build fully working early prototype \\
\hline

\section{Project Plan}

Given below is a Gantt Chart that shows the timeline of the requirements of the project.

\section{Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The project depends on the Acoustic Beamforming task only in the multi-channel audio case. The single-channel audio case does not need beamforming.
	\item Speech enhancement is optional and can be skipped, but performance of the system can decrease.
	\item All other tasks are dependent on the previous task.
\end{itemize}

\section{Time-critical tasks}
The most time critical task is segmentation and clustering by far, as is the core of the diarization process.
