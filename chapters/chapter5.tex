\chapter{Conclusions}

In conclusion, building a speaker diarization system can be a challenging task but a highly rewarding one. The most interesting innovations in this field in the recent years seem to be the use of i-vectors and x-vectors for speaker representation, using BLSTM for SAD, and using Variational Bayes for segmentation refinement. Indeed many DIHARD I submissions seem to be using these in their systems. Implementing these innovations can be desirable.
