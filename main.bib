@article{Verma2015,
	Abstract = {In the domain of speech recognition many methods have been proposed over time like Gaussian mixture models (GMM), GMM with universal background model (GMM-UBM framework), joint factor analysis, etc. i-Vector subspace modeling is one of the recent methods that has become the state of the art technique in this domain. This method largely provides the benefit of modeling both the intra-domain and inter-domain variabilities into the same low dimensional space. In this survey, we present a comprehensive collection of research work related to i-vectors since its inception. Some recent trends of using i-vectors in combination with other approaches are also discussed. The application of i-vectors in various fields of speech recognition, viz speaker, language, accent recognition, etc. is also presented. This paper should serve as a good starting point for anyone interested in working with i-vectors for speech processing in general. We then conclude the paper with a brief discussion on the future of i-vectors.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we aim to investigate the use of Variational Bayesian methods for audio indexing purposes. Variational Bayesian (VB) techniques are approximated techniques for fully Bayesian learning. Contrarily to non Bayesian methods (e.g. Maximum Likelihood) or partially Bayesian criterion (e.g. Maximum a Posteriori), VB benefits from important model selection properties. VB learning is based on the Free Energy optimization; Free Energy can be used at the same time as an objective function and as a model selection criterion allowing simultaneous model learning/model selection. Here we explore the use of VB learning and VB model selection in a speaker clustering task comparing results with classical learning techniques (ML and MAP) and classical model selection criteria (BIC). Experiments are run on the evaluation data set NIST-1996 HUB-4 and results show that VB can outperform classical methods.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe the ICSI-SRI entry in the Rich Transcription 2005 Spring Meeting Recognition Evaluation. The current system is based on the ICSI-SRI clustering system for Broadcast News (BN), with extra modules to process the different meetings tasks in which we participated. Our base system uses agglomerative clustering with a modified Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) measure to determine when to stop merging clusters and to decide which pairs of clusters to merge. This approach does not require any pre-trained models, thus increasing robustness and simplifying the port from BN to the meetings domain. For the meetings domain, we have added several features to our baseline clustering system, including a ``purification'' module that tries to keep the clusters acoustically homogeneous throughout the clustering process, and a delay{\&}sum beamforming algorithm which enhances signal quality for the multiple distant microphones (MDM) sub-task. In post-evaluation work we further improved the delay{\&}sum algorithm, experimented with a new speech/non-speech detector and proposed a new system for the lecture room environment.},
